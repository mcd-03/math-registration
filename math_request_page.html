            <h1>Our recommendation</h1>
            <p>Congratulations on nearing the end of a successful school year! 
            As you prepare to register your child for 7th grade, we would like to share our math recommendation, 
            which is based on multiple data points including input from your child’s current teacher. 
            <b>Our recommendation: Math 1</b>
            Although your child was recommended for Math 1, the final decision of what math you would like your 
            child to take in 7th grade is up to you. The information below outlines your child's options for math 
            classes next year and the impact of those courses on their 8th grade year.
